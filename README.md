# Q1.Simulate and implement go back n sliding window protocol.
Go-Back-N protocol, also called Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat reQuest, is a data link layer protocol that uses a sliding window method for reliable and sequential delivery of data frames. It is a case of sliding window protocol having to send window size of N and receiving window size of 1.

# Q2.Simulate Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) error detection algorithm for noisy channel.
CRC stands for Cyclic Redundancy Check. It is an error-detecting code used to determine if a block of data has been corrupted commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value attached, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their contents.
